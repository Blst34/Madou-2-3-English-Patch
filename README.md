# Madou 2-3 english patch
An english patch for Madou Monogatari 2 and 3 by Compile<br>
<br>
Here are instructions and some notes for playing.<br>

## --Patching--<br>
To patch the game, you will need to take out the files you need to patch with the disk explorer tool. 
<br>(available from https://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA013937/editdisk/index_e.html)<br>

with it, take the files out from your respective madou system disk image (example: madou 2 system disk)
patch them with the english patches, and with the disk explorer tool, import them back in, preferrably to a copy
of the system disk image, just in case.<br>

## --Playing--<br>
To play the game, you will need to insert the system disk into the first floppy disk drive(FDD1) and the sampling disk
into the second floppy disk drive(FDD2) and as long as everything is okay, it will work<br>

## --Saving--<br>
To save the game, you will need a seperate floppy disk image as a data disk, any image will work.
though, if you're making a fresh data disk, you will need to format it ingame.
after you have all that, to save or load, you will need to swap out the sampling disk (aka FDD2) with the data disk during saving or loading, then
after you've saved or loaded, swap it back with the sampling disk.

## !!--Important--!!<br>
Because this is a little rushed, there are issues, so if you can, report them.
