# Madou 2-3 English Patch
An english patch for Madou Monogatari 2 and 3 by Compile<br>
<br>
Here are instructions and some notes for playing.<br>

## --Patching--<br>
To patch the game, you will need to take out the files (same filenames as the filenames of the patch files)<br> you need to patch with the Disk Explorer tool. 
<br>(available from https://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA013937/editdisk/index_e.html)<br>
with it, take the files out from your respective Madou system disk image (example: madou 2 system disk)
patch them with the English patches, and with the Disk Explorer tool, import them back in, preferrably to a spare copy
of the system disk image, just in case.<br>

Or in short:<br>
1) Take a backup of the Madou system disk(s).
2) Extract the necessary files from the Madou system disk(s).
3) Download the patch files [here](https://github.com/Blst34/Madou-2-3-English-Patch/releases/).
4) Patch the extracted files with a patcher tool [like this one](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/), if it doesn't work, you can also use [this](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/).
5) Import the patched files back into the Madou system disk(s).

## --Playing--<br>
To play the game, you will need to insert the system disk into the first floppy disk drive(FDD1)
and the sampling disk into the second floppy disk drive(FDD2) and as long as everything is okay, it will work.<br>
<br>
For emulation, I recommend using Neko Project 2, as it's the emulator I used in testing. 
Emulation settings can be kept default, but you can probably tweak them for a better experience.

## --Saving--<br>
To save the game, you will need a separate floppy disk image as a data disk, any image will work.
though, if you're making a fresh data disk, you will need to format it in-game.
after you have all that, to save or load, you will need to swap out the sampling disk (aka FDD2) with the data disk during saving or loading,
then after you've saved or loaded, swap it back with the sampling disk.

## !!--Important--!!<br>
Because this is a little rushed, there are issues, so if you can, please report them.<br>

### --Known issues--<br>
Several pieces of text are a little weird. (especially the text for getting an item drop from enemies, which is like "enemy Ha item Dropped a")<br>
Names of areas on the map screen are messy.<br>
